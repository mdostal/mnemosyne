# Changelog

All notable changes to Mnemosyne are documented here.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Standalone UI** (`GET /ui`) — zero-dep browser shell over the existing HTTP
  service: liveliness + read-only settings, lanes (scopes) browser with
  add-lane, collections search (recall/grep with full provenance), a
  vanilla-SVG impact-graph view, and Operations panel (targeted reindex +
  local-cache refresh — deliberately never a Qdrant wipe).
- **Claude Code skill harness** (`skills/mnemosyne-standalone/`,
  `bin/mnemosyne-skill-helper.mjs`) — lets a bare Claude Code session drive a
  standalone Mnemosyne instance (auto-starts the service if not already
  running) without Pantheon present.
- **MCP server** (`bin/mnemosyne-mcp.mjs`) — the third standalone harness
  surface. Exposes `recall`, `remember`, `grep`, `reindex`, `graph_stats`,
  `graph_edges`, `graph_impact`, `graph_deps` as MCP tools over stdio, for
  any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, T3 Chat, etc.).
  Registered as this repo's own project-scoped MCP server (`.mcp.json`).
- New HTTP endpoints: `GET /config`, `GET /search`, `GET /graph/*`,
  `POST /lanes`, `POST /index`, `POST /cache/refresh`.
- Real, live-verified benchmark (`npm run benchmark:recall-vs-find`) proving
  recall beats a full-file-read "find" baseline on token cost.

### Fixed

- `lib/mnemosyne/client.ts`'s `MnemosyneClient.remember()` was a stub
  returning fake success with no real write. Now delegates to a real
  vector-layer write path (mirrors `src/engine.mjs`'s proven pattern:
  additive note write + `swarm-memory index --no-prune`, loud failure on
  any error).
- `benchmarks/recall-vs-find.ts` never awaited its `recall()` call and used
  a hardcoded fake "find" baseline; now measures both sides for real.
- Reconciled a significant `main`/`dev` divergence (77 commits) — `dev`'s
  TypeScript layer-adapter implementation (file/vector/code-graph layers,
  continuous indexing, Minerva-integration library) is now unified with the
  zero-dep JS HTTP service on one history.

### Changed

- `north_star` success criteria reframed: standalone-first via any harness
  (hooks/MCP/skillsets) is the actual target, not bespoke per-god wiring.
